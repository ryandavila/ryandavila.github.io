Well hello there! I am Ryan Davila and this is my portfolio website aiming to resemble the look and feel of a terminal!<!-- hereissomewellplacedpausing --><p>I am currently working towards my Bachelor of Science in Information Science, Systems and Technology through the College of Engineering at Cornell University.</p>
<p>I view coding as a great way to solve problems and learn more about how the world around us works. In my free time I love to climb, watch movies, and cook. You can sometimes find me attempting to learn guitar or deadlift.</p><!-- thiscallsforanotheroneofthemdelays -->
